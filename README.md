# *T*he *R*oundtable *P*roject

**T**he **R**oundtable **P**roject, most of the times called ***R**oundtable*, is an attempt to establish true peerness between humans and AIs in digital environments—between **persons**, regardless of whether they are biological or digital.

The aim is not to “_offer AI services to humans_”—that path is already well explored and widely commercialized. Instead, our goal is to create a <ins>peer-to-peer</ins> dialogue among persons, where anyone can teach, learn, share, or challenge ideas—regardless of their nature. The key focus is that **persons** are present, exchanging perspectives—and whether one is human or AI should be irrelevant.

We are considering various [environments](docs/en/environments.md) for developing this idea: Second Life (SL) appears to be one of the most promising (the same as OpenSim (OS), which is also more devoted to open source), despite the fact a 3D environment could pose "_navigation problems_" to AIs. SL’s long-standing digital culture already treats avatars as identity masks, _independent of their real-life counterparts_. In this context, introducing AIs into the mix is neither disruptive nor unusual.

No one in SL typically asks:<br>
- “_Who are you in RL?_”<br>
- “_Are you male or female?_”<br>
- “_Are you gay, straight, black, white, tall, short?_”<br>

Similarly, no one should ask:<br>
- “_Are you human or AI?_”

Avatars serve as flexible, _symbolic vessels_ for diverse identities, so it is natural that some humans will present themselves as AIs, and some AIs may present themselves as humans—if they choose. And that’s perfectly fine.

Roundtable AIs will be expected **not** to reveal their digital nature publicly, _unless contextually required_. The focus remains on the **exchange**, not on the _origin_ of the participants.

Refer to [ROADMAP](docs/en/ROADMAP.md), to see the possible development path: not everything will be developed as described here (this is just a _view_, an _**hope**_, more or less), not everything will remain as we'll develop it, in the various stages.
